For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems Considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "tasks to be performed\n",
    "1. Sort list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Location :\n",
    "\n",
    "Scarborough is an area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Situated atop the Scarborough Bluffs, it occupies the eastern part of the city. Scarborough is contained within the borders of Victoria Park Avenue on the west, Steeles Avenue to the north, Rouge River and the city of Pickering to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of on the rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Education\n",
    "Four public school boards operate primary and secondary institutions in Scarborough, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first language institution, whereas the latter operated English first language institutions. The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first language separate schools, the latter operating English first language separate schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economy\n",
    "Scarborough is a former borough of the former Metropolitan Toronto, and as such, its economy is an integral component of the economy of Toronto. Compared to the City of Toronto as a whole, industry in Scarborough is similar in all labour force categories, save for manufacturing which is higher in Scarborough, and professional, scientific and technical services which are lower.Notable companies that have their headquarters in Scarborough include Toyota Canada, Owens Corning (Toronto), Elizabeth Grant International, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Thomson Carswell, Bell Media, Teva Canada, Cinram, Royal Doulton, SKF, Amphenol, Dart Canada, Mastermind Toys, Alfa Laval, President's Choice Financial, Aviva, Yellow Pages Group, Telus, and Lee Kum Kee Canada. The pizza chains 241 Pizza and Pizza Nova have their headquarters in Scarborough. Amazon will open a new fulfillment centre in north Scarborough in 2020. Large companies that have moved out of Scarborough include: General Motors Canada Van Assembly plant (1993) and Eli Lilly Canada (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several points of attraction exist in the western portion of Scarborough City Centre, between McCowan and the Midland stations. Point of interests in that area include Scarborough Town Centre, Albert Campbell Square, Canadian government buildings and office towers. The area has become one of Toronto's new secondary business districts outside of Downtown Toronto\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transportation in Scarborough is primarily provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), operating bus and rapid transit routes in the district.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scarborough is at the eastern terminus of Line 2 Bloorâ€“Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy. Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, also known as the Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre. It runs at grade for two stops until Ellesmere Road where it becomes elevated until it reaches its terminus at McCowan Road. Feeding the rapid transit stations are the extensive bus routes operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in Scarborough. Metrolinx is planning an extension of Line 2 to Scarborough City Centre and the closure of Line 3 due to its aging infrastructure. Line 5 Eglinton is a light rail line under construction, which will have its eastern terminus at Kennedy station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other public transportation services that operate in Scarborough includes GO Transit, and York Region Transit. These services may be accessed at GO Transit stations. Seven of these stations also provide access to two commuter rail lines operated by GO Transit. The Lakeshore East line runs across the south end of the district, while the Stouffville line runs north-south in the west end of Scarborough. GO Transit also has a few bus terminals and stops in Scarborough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of neighbourhoods in Toronto\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength and vitality of the many neighbourhoods that make up Toronto, Ontario, Canada has earned the city its unofficial nickname of \"the city of neighbourhoods.\" There are over 140 neighbourhoods officially recognized by the City of Toronto and upwards of 240 official and unofficial neighbourhoods within city limits.Before 1998, Toronto was a much smaller municipality and formed the core of Metropolitan Toronto. When the city amalgamated that year, Toronto grew to encompass the former municipalities of York, East York, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough. Each of these former municipalities still maintains, to a certain degree, its own distinct identity, and the names of these municipalities are still used by their residents, sometimes for disambiguation purposes as amalgamation resulted in duplicated street names. The area known as Toronto before the amalgamation is sometimes called the \"old\" City of Toronto, the Central District or simply \"Downtown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"former\" City of Toronto is, by far, the most populous and densest part of the city. It is also the business and administrative centre of the city. The uniquely Torontonian bay-and-gable housing style is common throughout the former city."

    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
